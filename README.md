# PasswordChecker
Using understanding of API and Python3, we are able to create a password checker so that we can input any password that we have and check if it has ever been hacked. 
### `python3 checkmypass.py *password1* *password2* *password3*`
password1, password2 and password3 are the inputs for this command. We can check many passwords as we like.
For example:
### `python3 checkmypass.py hello thisismypass MinhTranUNSW`
The output would be like this:
### `hello was found 253581 times... you should probably change your password!`
### `thisismypass was found 776 times... you should probably change your password!`
### `MinhTranUNSW was NOT found. Carry on!`
